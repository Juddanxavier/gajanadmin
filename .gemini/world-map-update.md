# ✅ World Map Updates

## 🛠️ **Changes Made**

1. **Removed Zoom**: The map is now static and fixed in position. Removed the
   `ZoomableGroup` component.
2. **Transparent Background**: Removed the gray background from the map
   container. It now sits directly on the card background.

## 📄 **Updated File**

`components/dashboard/world-map-choropleth.tsx`

## 🚀 **How it looks now**

- The map is centered and fits the container.
- No zoom or pan interactions (click to zoom is gone).
- The background behind the countries is transparent (showing the card style).

## 💡 **Next Steps**

- Refresh your dashboard to see the changes.
- Since it's on the dashboard, it will look cleaner without the extra background
  box.
